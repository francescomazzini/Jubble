# Branch strategy
Since the beginning, we approached the development on different branches, using a flexible policy but keeping the principle of keeping the working code on two branches.

- Master: was where the release code was released. 
Since we worked only one version of the game, only tags close to the first alpha release will be uploaded.

- Dev_main: was where we merged the stable code of the project, merged from side branches created for every small feature when possible.


Close to the end of the project, where the code was starting to becoming more stable and we learned the best practices, we started feeling the utility to use gitlab issues, in order to keep the focus on the remaining features and track better the work.
From this, in the final days we extended the branching techniques to side branches that were opened directly from the issues.
