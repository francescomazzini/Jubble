# JubbleðŸš€

A "spacial" multithreading incremental game you can play via javafx or via a telegram bot.

Run Javafx app.

```
mvn clean compile exec:java@javafx
```

Run telegram bot.

```
mvn clean compile exec:java@telegram
```

Build project and verify code style

```
mvn clean verify
```

Generate code style report

```
mvn checkstyle:check
```

Temporal command for formatting:

```
mvn com.coveo:fmt-maven-plugin:format
```

# Game mechanics
Basing on the typical model of tycoon games, the game is composed by:

- A main character (the player)
- An environment (the space)
- Unexpected events/accidents caused by external events where the player will have the possibility to choose how he should go ahead gaining pros or cons of their choice (not implemented)
- A Platonic goal to achieve by the player: accumulate resources endlessly.


The total production (or balance) is computed with:

$production_{total} = (production_{base} \times owned) \times multipliers$

_Where:_

$production_{base}$: costant of the $owned$: number of owned generators.

$multipliers$: current prestige of the player.

## Next Steps

What could we add in the future versions:

- [ ] Implement the concept of derivative currencies.
- [ ] Add random events during the game experience.
